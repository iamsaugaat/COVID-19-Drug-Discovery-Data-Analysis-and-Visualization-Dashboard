# COVID-19-Drug-Discovery-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Dashboard
This project analyzes molecular data from a publicly available COVID-19 drug discovery dataset. Using data science workflows (Python, pandas, scikit-learn) and visual analytics (Seaborn, Matplotlib, Streamlit), we explored the physicochemical properties of drug-like compounds and their relationship with antiviral activity.
